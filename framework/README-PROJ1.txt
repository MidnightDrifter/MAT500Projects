Please use the 'clear' functionality in order to clear out any pre-existing points before starting Project 1.

The core functionality is fairly straightforward, and it follows the same general procedure as the original framework.
Drag points with RMB, increase the number of points by ticking up the 'Project 1 Degree' box.
Project 1 must be enabled, and only 'DeCasteljeau' and 'Bernstein' work for this project, currently.
